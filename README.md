# Stock Analysis with VBA 
## Overview

**Purpose**

This analysis was performed in order to evaluate the stock market performance of select "green" companies. VBA code was used to collect and aggregate stock data for the identified companies. Performance results per stock were calculated and printed on a new sheet within the workbook. The main goal of this project was to evaluate and refactor code. The orginal code was provided in a .vbs file and refactoring was required in order to increase efficiencies.

**VBA Code**

The script was designed to collect and aggregate information on each stock ticker provided. The code allows for the user to select which year (2017 or 2018) of data to evaluate. The script then loops through the data for the appropriate year, aggregating the total volume by stock ticker. It also finds the first and last instance of a stock ticker and its associated stock price. These were then used to calculate the return rate for the given year. Finally, the results were outputted onto a separate tab and formatted for easy-to-read analysis.
